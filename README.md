This is the fisrt task in this internship.
In this task I analyzed car_prices dataset from Kaggle using python and Pandas.

WHAT I DID
-> Cleaned the dataset by removing missing and duplicate rows by using the command "df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)" this deletes duplicate rows.
To view the dataset i printed the dataset
-> After removing of duplicates I ensures that "make" column in lower letters by using "df['make'] = df['make'].str.lower().str.strip()"
->In the next step set the "saledate" in the format of "DD-MM-YYYY"
-> to check the dataset displayed the dataset
