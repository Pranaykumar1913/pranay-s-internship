Welcome to task2 !
In this Task I am going to do Data Visualization and Story telling using Power Bi by Creating visualizations that convey a compelling story.

To creating this I have loaded "AmazonSales " Dataset from Kaggle, cleaned the dataset using python then loaded it into Power BI
-> now in the first page named page1 I have used "Clustered Column Chart" to visualize the data sum of discount_percentage by category
   then added "slicer' to select and view perticular category
   and used "card visualization" for "discount percentage" which shows about percentage of discount 

-> In the page2 I hve used "Pie Chart" to visualize sum of actual_price by category then added a slicer and card to show actual sum of price
-> In page3 named "discount percentage" I hve used "Stacked Column Chart" to visualize discounted_percentage by actual_price and added card
-> In page4 named "Summary" I hve used "KPI chart" to visualize count of rating by category to know the details of report dataset i hve add      "message" which gives information about dataset by asking questions.
